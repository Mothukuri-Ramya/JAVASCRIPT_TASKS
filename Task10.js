//a.Define the Book Class. The class should take parameters for title, author, publisher, year, and genre. Inside the constructor method, set these parameters as properties of the book object.

class Book{
    constructor(title,author,publisher,year,genre){
        this.title=title;
        this.author=author;
        this.publisher=publisher;
        this.year=year;
        this.genre=genre;
    }
//b.Add a method named describe() that logs a brief description of the book, combining the title, author, and year, e.g., "Five Point Someone - Chetan Bhagat (2004)

    describe(){
        console.log(`${this.title} - ${this.author} (${this.year})`);

    }
//c.Add a method named displayGenre() that logs the genre of the book.

    displayGenre(){
        console.log(`${this.genre}`);
    }
}

//d.Create an object named classicBook with properties representing a classic novelâ€™s details. Log this object to the console.
let classicBook=new Book("Wings of Fire", "Abdul Kalam", "Press", 1999, "Autobiography");
console.log(classicBook);

//e.Create an object named sciFiBook with properties representing a science fiction book. Log this object to the console.
let sciFiBook=new Book("The Time Machine", "H.G. Wells", "Heinemann", 1895, "Science Fiction");
console.log(sciFiBook);

//f.On the classicBook object, call the describe() method to see a summary of the book.
classicBook.describe();

//g.Call the displayGenre() method on the sciFiBook object to log the genre.
sciFiBook.displayGenre();
